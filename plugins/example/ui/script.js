 * JQUERY TIME!

 * Like i said, there's a lot of limitations for this one.
 * You need to use id to specify a query selector instead of class because that would trigger other class on the other plugin
 *
 * See the example below:
 */
$("#someDiv").html("<h1>Hello World!</h1>"); // This is Right ✔️, it would generated as $("#example-uniqueDiv")
$(".container").html("<h1>Hello World!</h1>"); // This is WRONG ❌, it would trigger all DOM with container class across all plugins.

/**
 * There're also a limitations when you creating a function.
 * Since script would be apply globally, i suggest you to wrap a function inside a class instead of declaring it globally.
