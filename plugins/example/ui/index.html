<!-- 
    This was an example of the NUI system on a plugin.
    ---

    Notes:

    1. The NUI would automatically used if the plugin folder contains 'nui' folder.
    2. NUI starting point is 'index.html', so make sure have the main file with the name of 'index.html'.
    3. You don't need to use <html>, <head> or <body> tag, just put all the content inside it.
    4. If you wanted to use <head> or <body> tag, that's okay, but at the end it would not be rendered, only the content inside it that would be rendered.
    5. Jquery is set Globally, you could use Jquery on here without need to importing it.
    6. If you're referencing a files make sure to use ./ or @/ at the links in the front.

    Conclusion:

    What actually happens on here is that all nui files would be merged as 1 things

    Let's learn and see more example below
 -->

<html>
    <head>
        <!-- (OPTIONAL) Use this meta to adjust the index of the NUI between other plugin NUI, if this one is not available, the default value would be 1 -->
        <meta name="nuiIndex" content="1" />

        <!-- 
            1. Stylesheet MUST be imported / MUST be an external stylesheet, this stylesheet would ONLY APPLY ON THIS PLUGIN 
            2. You MUST use ./ or @/ in the links in the front
        -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="@/someOtherStyle.css" />

        <!-- If you are using css inside this HTML, then the css would apply GLOBALLY, be careful -->
        <style>
            .someCSSDiv {
                opacity: 0;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- 
            If you're putting an id, make sure it's unique across other plugins.

            As for that, i suggest you to write an id with the plugin name such as `example-uniqueDiv`
        -->
        <div class="container" id="example-uniqueDiv"></div>

        <!-- It's okay whether you wanted to use script on here or had the script as external source to be imported -->
        <script>
            /**
             * We don't use classic document.addEventListener on here, but we're using events just like normally.
             * - Learn about the list of events on https://developer.natuna.asia/fivem/modules/NUI.html
             */
            window.on("copytext", (data) => {
                const node = document.createElement("textarea");
                const selection = document.getSelection();

                node.textContent = data.text;
                document.body.appendChild(node);

                selection.removeAllRanges();
                node.select();
                document.execCommand("copy");

                selection.removeAllRanges();
                document.body.removeChild(node);
            });

            /**
             * JQUERY TIME!
             * ---
             *
             * Like i said, there's a lot of limitations for this one.
             * You need to use id to specify a query selector instead of class because that would trigger other class on the other plugin
             *
             * See the example below:
             */
            $("#example-uniqueDiv").html("<h1>Hello World!</h1>"); // This is Right ✔️
            $(".container").html("<h1>Hello World!</h1>"); // This is WRONG ❌, it would trigger all DOM with container class across all plugins.
        </script>

        <!-- 
            There're also a limitations when you creating a function. Since script would be apply globally, i suggest you to wrap a function inside a class instead of declaring it globally.
         -->
        <script>
            new (class {
                constructor() {
                    // Any functions or variable or things written on here, would only apply locally on this class so it would not conflict with other function on another plugin
                    // Do some works here...
                }
            })();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
